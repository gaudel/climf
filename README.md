CLiMF Collaborative Less-is-More Filtering, a variant of latent factor CF
which optimises a lower bound of the smoothed reciprocal rank of "relevant"
items in ranked recommendation lists.  The intention is to promote diversity
as well as accuracy in the recommendations.  The method assumes binary
relevance data, as for example in friendship or follow relationships.
